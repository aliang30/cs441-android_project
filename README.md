Android Application - Units Converter
Project 1 Description (README)

For my Android project, I utilized Android Studio to develop a simple units converter android application. It has the following options you can pick from when converting: inches to feet, feet to inches, inches to meters, meters to inches, liters to gallons, gallons to liters, pounds to kilograms, and kilograms to pounds. Although the options are limited, it is really simple to use and can be quite handy. This application contains several radio buttons that you can click on when choosing from the list of options and when you hit the convert button, the conversion will be shown at the top of the screen. 
I also applied a background that was easily made with Photoshop so that it fits the theme of education. Before I dived into Android Studio and started coding, I drew out a simple and effective layout to the application. After that, I would drag the widgets to make sure they fit properly on the screen and then I implemented button functionalities. As I progress, I would modify other features such as the title/status bar, font type, background, etc.
